Teacher: Would you please take a seat, [bk]Kurumi@?
Kurumi: Y-yes ma'am..!
She points to an unoccupied desk in the back of the room.
The class buzzes with low-pitched chatter as I make my way through the rows of students.
Student: Another transfer, at this time of year?
Student: At least it's a girl this time!
Student: ...I don't know, how do you think you did on that test?
I do my best to tune it out.
As I'm about to reach my desk, I bump my leg into an unexpected object and suddenly lose my balance.
Kurumi: [b3]Aaah@!
I feel a hand reach for mine, keeping me upright.
As I turn around, I notice who it is.
A blast of color fills my vision, it's this girl's pink hair.
Pink Hair: Try not to be such a klutz. Seriously.
I'd never seen anything quite like it before.
Kurumi: I... %I mean, your...
She turns around and goes back to staring out the window.
Kurumi: Um...
She doesn't even bother to respond.
Kurumi: ...
I guess that's just how some people are.
I sit down, noticing that my desk isn't far behind hers.
