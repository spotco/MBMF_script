I'll grab her book. %She basically just offered it, after all.
Kurumi: Sorry! This'll just take a second...
I stand up from my seat, sneakily grabbing the book out of my neighbor's hands as I do.
Teacher: Whenever you're ready, [bk]Kurumi@.
Kurumi: Umm...
I scan over the page to find the correct starting spot.
Kurumi: [b3]#The Japanese archipelago is divided into four main islands...#
Geography. Nothing too difficult.
I read through it without too much trouble.
Teacher: Thank you, [bk]Kurumi@. That'll be enough for now.
I take a seat and sigh in relief.
Kurumi: That went surprisingly well.
I place it back on my neighbor's desk, smiling sheepishly as I do.
Kurumi: Thanks for letting me borrow it!
Kurumi: Think I left mine back home.
She smiles and nods enthusiastically.
Glasses Girl: It's no biggie! %...Not at all!
Kurumi: You really saved me back there... [b3]Um...@
Glasses Girl: [bn]Naoko@.
Naoko: Nice... to meet you!
Kurumi: [bn]Naoko@..?
Kurumi: It's nice to meet you too.
Glasses Girl: [b3]Hehe@...
Glasses Girl: We'll be seeing a lot more of each other, being neighbors and all.
Kurumi: Yeah...
[bn]Naoko@... %She's a bit strange, but I can tell her heart's in the right place.
I look over at her textbook for the rest of class.
