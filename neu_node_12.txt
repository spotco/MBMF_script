I hear the familiar chime of a school bell. It must be noon.
Students spring from their seats the second class ends. Looks like everyone's in a hurry to get lunch.
I quickly grab the textbook I borrowed and head over to [br]Yuuto@'s desk by the front of the room.
Kurumi: Excuse me..?
He turns to me, a pleasant smile on his face.
Yuuto: Hi there... [bk]Kurumi@, right?
Kurumi: Yep! I wanted to return this to you.
I hand him the textbook, which he slides into his bag.
Kurumi: Thanks for letting me borrow it!
He grins.
Yuuto: Not a problem. I had an extra.
Yuuto: Us transfer students gotta stick together, right?
He pauses for a moment.
Yuuto: You mentioned you had just moved to this city. %Is that so?
Kurumi: That's right.
Yuuto: Well... %Since we're both new here...
Yuuto: I hope we can be friends!
He flashes a wide smile.
Yuuto: Don't you think so?
Kurumi: ...
That was unexpected.
But I've got no reason to believe he isn't being serious.
Kurumi: Well...
I smile back.
Kurumi: ...I don't see why not.
He gently pushes in his chair and swings his book bag over his shoulder.
Yuuto: Would you care to join me for lunch?
Yuuto: I'd be more than happy to show you around the school.
Yuuto: Or at least, the parts of it I've seen.
Kurumi: I...
I had packed my own lunch today.
But... I would feel bad refusing a generous offer like that.
Kurumi: I'll take you up on that.
I follow him through the hall and down the stairs. We push through the current of hungry students.
Navigating our way through the crowd, we reach the school store.
Lined upon the shelves are rows of sandwiches, snacks, and sweets available for purchase.
I grab a neatly wrapped sandwich and follow him outside to the courtyard.
We head to a large courtyard in the middle of the school.
It looks like a pretty popular place. Groups of students are out and about everywhere I look.
We find a spot to sit and unpack our meals.
Yuuto: So, [bk]Kurumi@... %If you don't mind me asking.
Yuuto: What brought you here?
Kurumi: ...Why do you ask?
He laughs.
Yuuto: Like you heard before...
Yuuto: You don't see a whole lot of people transfering in the middle of the year.
Yuuto: So... %It must be something important.
Yuuto: Am I right or what?
It wasn't something I had really thought about before.
Kurumi: Well...
Oddly enough, however, I didn't have a straight answer to give.
I knew it was all related to what my parents did. Something work related.
Beyond that? I couldn't really say.
I take a big gulp of water and swallow down my lunch.
Kurumi: You know. Parents and work... that kind of thing.
A pretty standard response.
He looks perplexed.
Yuuto: Were you... %Forced here against your will?
Kurumi: [b3]N-no@, that's not it at all! Was that what it sounded like?
He nods.
Yuuto: Happens pretty often.
I thought about it for a moment. How exactly did I feel?
Kurumi: Coming here, it was all on such a short notice. %I was just... nervous. And anxious.
Kurumi: But also excited, too!
Yuuto: Well, that's good.
Kurumi: Well... it was always so plain and boring, living in the small town where I was before.
Kurumi: I knew I was missing out. There was so much more I wanted to see.
Kurumi: Do you know what I mean?
He smiles.
Yuuto: Well, can't say I really do.
Yuuto: But it's good that you're looking at it in a positive light.
Kurumi: ...You think so?
He nods again.
Yuuto: I'm almost jealous!
Yuuto: As for me...
He pauses for a moment.
Yuuto: I've had to move around a lot myself.
Yuuto: I wouldn't say I was ever too excited about it.
Kurumi: I... see.
That was unexpected.
Kurumi: Do you ever feel... [b3]Homesick@?
Yuuto: [b3]Homesick@?
Kurumi: Yeah. Like missing your home, or your friends...
A strange look crosses his face for a brief moment.
Yuuto: There are... just certain expectations I have to live up to.
Yuuto: I guess I don't have a whole lot of say in the matter.
He smiles again.
Yuuto: So... No, not really!
An intentionally vague, evasive answer.
There's something on his mind. I know it.
A brief moment of silence is suddenly interrupted by the abrupt buzzing of a cell phone.
It's [br]Yuuto's@ phone. He pulls it out of his pocket, checks it, and frowns slightly.
Kurumi: ...
Yuuto: We'll... have to do this again.
His attitude changed in the blink of an eye.
This sounded serious.
Yuuto: I'm going to have to leave early.
He stands up, packing his belongings.
Yuuto: I'll see you around.
Kurumi: [b3]O-of@ course...
And with that, he left.
Kurumi: ...
[br]Yuuto@... He seemed like an interesting person.
I couldn't help but feel that something about him was... %Distant. %Unreachable.
As if a part of him was hidden away, locked in a world apart from our own.
Kurumi: ...
Kurumi: I guess everyone's got their secrets.
Kurumi: I shouldn't try to pry into his.
