I was only even told that I'd be moving earlier this week.
In the brief span of a few short days, I had to say goodbye to the world I knew.
Even my parents wouldn't be here for some time.
It was odd. It wasn't anything I could have even imagined happening.
But, here I was.
And at the same time...
Wasn't it what I always wanted?
Ever since I was little, I'd dreamed of moving somewhere else.
In my hometown, it seemed as if nothing ever changed.
It felt like I lived the same dull life every day.
But now? %Expected or not, this was an opportunity.
Things should be different here.
A bright, beaming smile bursts across my face.
I'm... excited!
I type up an enthusiastic reply and send it back.
Then, feeling satisfied, I tuck away my phone and head for bed.
