I decide to tell the truth.
Kurumi: I'm sorry. I think I forgot to bring my books today.
The teacher frowns at me.
Teacher: I don't know how they do things where you're from...
Teacher: But here, you're always expected to come to class prepared.
She sighs.
Teacher: Well, that being said... %Does anyone have an extra they can lend?
She looks out over the class.
Someone in front raises their hand. It's the other transfer student, [br]Yuuto@.
He pulls out a textbook from his bag and passes it back.
Yuuto: Don't worry about it! It happens to the best of us.
He flashes a quick smile before turning back around.
The book makes its way back to me through the seated students.
It's brand new. The pages feel crisp in my hand.
I flip to the right section and smile at the teacher.
She clears her throat and continues from where she left off.
Teacher: As I was saying...
Geography. %Nothing too difficult.
I get through it without too much trouble.
The energetic girl with glasses turns back to her desk and begins intently taking notes.
Whatever she's writing down, she sure is passionate about it.
I spot a name written in faded cursive on the top corner of the page.
[bn]Naoko@...
Kurumi: [bn]Naoko@, is it?
Kurumi: I should probably thank her later...
