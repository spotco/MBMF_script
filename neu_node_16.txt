The halls are completely quiet. My footsteps echo through the unnatural silence.
There hasn't been a single person in sight.
Whatever is going on, this place must be completely deserted.
Despite all of that, I've got an inexplicable sense that I'm not the only one here.
Even with that intuition, finding whoever or whatever it is could be a completely different story.
Not knowing where to start, I check the neighboring classrooms.
I doubt I'll find anything.
More empty desks and chairs.
Nothing of note here.
I look through the window.
A thick, dense fog hangs in the air obscuring any view of the world outside.
The red ambient light filtering through is unlike any natural phenomenon I've seen of.
Dozens of unanswered questions run through my mind.
However, I've got a more pressing task at hand.
I continue my search.
