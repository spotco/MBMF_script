I find myself sitting alone in the school courtyard, my half-finished lunch sitting idly on my lap.
Groups of students hang out nearby, talking and laughing amongst themselves.
Part of me wants to approach one of them.
I really ought to be meeting new people and making friends.
But at the same time, I find it hard to put myself out there like that.
My indecisiveness gets the better of me, and I finish my lunch alone.
When it comes to this kind of stuff, I guess I've still got a long way to go.
