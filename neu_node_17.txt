If I wanted to be alone, where would I be?
An idea thought pops up into my head.
It wouldn't hurt to check.
I make my way over to the bathroom.
It's rather difficult to see in this dim light.
In the corner of my eye, I notice a sudden movement.
Startled, I turn around.
A mirror. Nothing unusual about it.
Checking my reflection, I straighten my hair and adjust my skirt.
Everything seems to be in order.
With more pressing tasks at hand, I continue my search.
