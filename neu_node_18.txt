I hear footsteps steadily approach as muffled voices echo from down the hall.
Someone must be here.
I quickly slip behind an open door, hiding myself out of sight.
Peeking out, I notice two silhouettes passing through in the dim light.
Two men, both wearing neatly pressed suits.
They stop. I quickly duck back behind the door.
Did they see me?
One of them speaks. A nervous man with an excitable tone.
Agent 1: It's close, isn't it?
Agent 1: Everything looks right.
I hear another voice. An older man.
He responds in a careful and measured tone.
Agent 2: I wouldn't be so quick to trust everything that boy says.
For a moment, they're both silent.
I'm just trying to piece together what they're talking about.
Agent 1: [b3]W-we@ should keep searching. It still might not be too late.
Agent 2: Very well.
I hold my breath in an attempt to remain absolutely silent.
After a few painfully long moments, I work up the courage to peek out again.
They're gone.
No trace of them, or that they were even here.
I breathe out.
Who were they, and what were they looking for?
I felt as if I would find the answer soon.
