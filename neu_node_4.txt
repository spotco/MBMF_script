I was only even told that I'd be moving earlier this week.
In the brief span of a few short days, I had to say goodbye to the world I knew.
Even my parents wouldn't be here for some time.
Something was odd. %It all felt suspicious.
I never did get any sort of explanation on why it all happened so suddenly.
I know I should trust them, and that there has to be a good reason behind everything.
But having that doubt in the back of my mind made me anxious.
Dozens unanswered questions float around in my head.
I'll have to ask them another time.
Letting out a sigh, I turn off my phone and put it on the counter.
Ever since I was little, I'd dreamed of moving somewhere else.
In my hometown, it seemed like nothing ever changed.
It felt as if I lived the same %dull life every day.
But now? %Like it or not, I was here.
I take deep breath. %Guess there's no point in worrying about it.
I turn off the light and head to bed.
