I decide to head back to class a bit early.
A familiar face passes by as I walk through the corridor.
It's [bn]Naoko@. Leaning against the wall, her eyes are unsurprisingly glued to her phone.
I didn't really get a chance to talk with her earlier.
Kurumi: How's it going, [bn]Naoko@?
Naoko: ...Ah!
She jumps, and with a loud crack her phone drops to the floor.
Kurumi: Oh no...
I reach down and pick it up for her. It's worse than expected.
A long, thin crack runs across the top right corner of the screen.
Kurumi: Gosh, [bn]Naoko@... %I'm sorry...
As I take a closer look, I notice what she had been staring at.
It's a chat room of some sort. There's a title at the top of the page.
#BIZARRE SUPERNATURAL Events in the City...#
...I realize I probably shouldn't be snooping about on something personal like this.
I hand the phone back over, feeling quite guilty.
Kurumi: Your screen...
She doesn't seem too upset.
If anything, it's like she's barely even noticed what happened.
Naoko: Oh... What? %No biggie, I drop it all the time...
She looks back down, her eyes once again fixating to the screen.
Naoko: I'll... see you back in class...
She doesn't sound too interested in continuing this conversation.
Whatever's going on in that chat room must be really important.
As if in some sort of trance, she wanders off.
Kurumi: Is she... alright?
Not knowing quite what to make of the situation, I head back to the classroom.
