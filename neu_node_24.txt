I'm alive.
Opening my eyes, I glance around.
A bed. I see multiple others beside mine, all empty.
This must be the nurse's office.
The setting sun shines through the curtain covering the window beside me.
Sliding them aside, I see the courtyard where I had just been.
It's the late afternoon. I see a few students outside scattered about outside.
It’s as if I had just woken up from a dream. One that had suddenly turned into a nightmare.
The image of that otherworldly beast still burned sharply into my mind.
I could almost still feel its breath on my face. That was too real to be just a dream.
Kurumi: Mmph...
Propping myself up, I glance around. Nobody in sight.
Getting up, I straighten out my uniform and hear footsteps outside the door to the hall.
Someone's there.
Yuuto: Finally awake?
As the door opens, I notice who it is.
Kurumi: Yuuto..?
Yuuto: You're not hurt, are you?
Kurumi: ...
I don't even know what to say. Where to begin..?
Kurumi: None of this makes any sense at all.
Kurumi: What exactly just happened? What was that thing I just saw..?
He hesitates for a moment.
Yuuto: So you remember all of it, don't you?
Kurumi: ...
Yuuto: I guess I've got some explaining to do.
He hesitates for a moment, as if carefully choosing his next words.
Yuuto: There’s a lot in this world that you might not have known about.
Yuuto: But, as for what you've just seen...
He pauses.
Yuuto: ...That was an 'anomalous magical event'.
Yuuto: Or just 'AME', for short. That's what we've started calling them.
Kurumi: Anomalous... Magical..?
It was a whole lot to take in all at once.
He smiles.
Yuuto: That's right. Magic.
Yuuto: You saw it for yourself.
Kurumi: ...
Magic? Could that really be the explanation behind all that just happened?
Gaging my reaction, he continues.
Yuuto: You see, it just happens that you've come at a most interesting time.
Kurumi: ...What do you mean by that?
Yuuto: Well...
Yuuto: Those events. The 'AMEs'. Lately, in this specific area...
Yuuto: They've been happening quite frequently. And we don't know the exact cause.
Kurumi: ...
Yuuto: If something were to ever escape, like that creature you just saw...
Yuuto: It wouldn't be good. I'm sure you can imagine.
Chills went down my spine just thinking about it.
Kurumi: If this was really so dangerous, how isn't this in the news?
Kurumi: Why don’t we call the police... or...
He shakes his head.
Yuuto: This kind of thing isn’t normally supposed to affect the normal world.
Yuuto: So, we’ve been doing our best to keep it all under control.
I thought about it.
Something didn’t add up.
Kurumi: Then... Why are you telling me?
He pauses again.
Yuuto: Whether or not you're aware, you have an ability.
Yuuto: Most people aren’t able to see these magical distortions.
Yuuto: But... You are.
Kurumi: What does that mean..?
Yuuto: Well...
Yuuto: It means that you’ve got some innate magical potential.
Kurumi: I... do?
Yuuto: That’s right.
Kurumi: ...
I didn't know what to believe anymore.
*Knock Knock*
I hear a sudden rap on the door.
An unfamiliar looking man in a sharp black suit walks inside.
With a stern grimace on his face, he speaks.
Manami: Yuuto. We've been looking for you. Where have you been?
Yuuto frowns as he turns around to face the suited man.
Yuuto: If you're still searching for the target...
Yuuto: ...Then you're wasting your time. It's already gone.
Manami: ...
The suited man closes his eyes, as if in frustration.
Manami: Very well. We'll call off the search.
Narrowing his eyes, he stares directly at me.
Manami: Who's this?
Kurumi: ...
Yuuto: She's my friend.
Yuuto: ...And she's got nothing to do with any of this.
Manami: I see.
Without another word, he leaves.
Yuuto: ...
For a brief moment, we both sit in silence.
Kurumi: What... was that about?
Yuuto: ...
With a serious look on his face, he turns to face me.
Yuuto: Listen. There's one last thing I haven't told you.
Kurumi: What is that?
Yuuto: Because of your abilities... You may be in danger.
Kurumi: D-danger..?!
Yuuto: I'll do my best to make sure that isn't the case.
Yuuto: But... I might need your help.
Kurumi: What do you mean..?
He smiles.
Yuuto: Don't worry too much about it, okay?
Yuuto: It won't be anything too big.
He gets up.
Yuuto: I'll see you tomorrow, alright?
He walks over to the door as if he was about to leave.
Stopping, he mentions one last thing.
Yuuto: I brought your stuff. It's over here in the corner.
Yuuto: Don't forget!
Kurumi: ...
As he leaves, I fall back into my bed.
It's a lot to think about.
