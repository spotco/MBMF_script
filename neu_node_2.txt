I'm finally here. %By myself, in this unfamiliar city.
It's late. %If I wanted to take a look around, it'd have to be another day.
Dragging my bags alongside me, I make my way to the apartment entrance.
As I step into the empty room, an unfamiliar feeling sinks in.
For the first time, as far as I could remember... %I felt alone.
My parents were thousands of miles away.
All my friends back home... %Who knew if I would ever see them again?
My phone buzzes from within my pocket. %I eagerly pick it up.
Me: It's...
It's [bk]Mom@. %I open the message.
#[bk]Kurumi@ - I hope everything was okay on your trip!#
#I know how hard things have been for you, leaving on such short notice.#
#But I know you'll get used to your new school in no time.#
My new school. %I had almost forgotten. %It starts tomorrow.
I keep reading.
#I'm sure you're anxious, and I wish I could be there with you.#
#But since I can't, [bk]Kurumi@, just know this.#
#I'll always looking out for you.#
#So we'll be seeing each other soon, okay?%     -Love, [bk]Mom@#
Kurumi: ...
My phone buzzes again just as I'm about to put it down.
Another message?
#Stay safe. Don't wander alone at night. [bk]Dad@.#
Kurumi: ...
My thumb hovers over the keyboard. What should I say...?
